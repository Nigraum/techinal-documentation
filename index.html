        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
          It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
          (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
          objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
          operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
          be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
          additional objects; for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
            For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
            elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
            clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
            server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
            database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
            another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
            server.
          </li>
        </ul>

          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
          different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
          does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
          JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
          and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
          renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
          declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
          number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
          values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
          more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
          provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
          for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
          any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
          objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
          have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
          to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
          protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
          parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

        To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
        your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
        <code>
          function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");
        </code>
        Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
        browser!
